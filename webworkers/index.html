<p>
This is an experiment in using Web Workers to calculate word frequency. Seems to work... Next I'll try it with a lot more text.
</p>
<p>
It works by iterating through each of the paragraphs above, tokenizing the text into separate words, and then sending each list to a <code>Worker</code> instance of <code><a href=counter.js>counter.js</a></code>, which counts up the words it receives, and sends back that tally to the main script, <code><a href=master.js>master.js</a></code>. That script takes all the counts and combines them into a total, and spits out the table up on the right. 
</p>
<p>
Notice that the word "albatross" is in two lists, and is counted twice.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure why, but you have to click the button twice.
