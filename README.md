This is a tool for counting words in prose text.

Instructions:

1. download
2. unzip folder
3. open index.html in your browser (I suggest Firefox, probably works ok in Chrome or Safari, untested in Internet Explorer, but it might work.)
4. Paste some text into the box at the top of the screen
5. click "calculate"
6. You can sort by any one of the columns by clicking on the heading (count, word, or reversed). Reversed is there in case you want to try to sort by the ending of words (finding all words that end in -mi É, for instnace). If you click again, it will reverse the order, so for instance if you click "count", it will sort from lowest to highest, and then if you click again, it will sort from highest to lowest.
7. If you want, you can click "export CSV" to get a popup window containing CSV-formatted text that you can paste into Excel if you want to do further processing.

Notes:
* it's not yet possible to restrict by matched fields "on the fly." I'm still working on that.
* the tokenization (word-splitting) algorithm is still quite simple. If you'd like any particular characters to be treated as non-letters, please let me know & I'll add them.
